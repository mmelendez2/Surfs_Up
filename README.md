# Surfs_Up
## Analyzing Weather Data using SQL Lite &amp; Flask

## Overview of the statistical analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze temperuature data for the months of June and December in Oahu within the past few years. This will help us determine if a surf and ice cream business is a viable investment and sustainable enough to operate year round. In this analysis, we've highlighted a few components within our exploratory climate analysis - the weather by date, the precipitation by date, and even gathered the minimum, average, and maximum tempartures within a range of dates. Finally, we displayed our data in a webpage by using Flask. Users can review our findings if provided with a link created with Flask.

## Results

### June
By pulling weather data for the months of June and December, we were able to create a DataFrame from the list of temperatures for both months. For June, we captured **1700** unique dates within the month of June alone and discovered the average temperature is **74.95° F**. The maxiumum temperature is **85.00° F** and the minimum is **64.00° F** in Oahu:
